            <div class="rule-section">
                <h3>1️⃣ Priority of Who Wins</h3>
                <ul class="rule-list">
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Self-draw (自摸, Zìmō)</span> has the highest priority – If a player wins by self-drawing a tile, no one else can claim it.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Robbing a Kong (抢杠胡, Qiǎnggànghú)</span> takes priority over a normal discard – If a player wins by robbing a Kong, they override anyone who would have won from a discard.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Single Winner Rule (头家优先, Tóujiā Yōuxiān)</span> – If two or more players can claim a discard for a win, the player closest to the discarder in turn order (right of the discarder) gets the tile.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Thirteen Orphans (十三幺, Shísān Yāo)</span> always overrides other hands – If someone is waiting for the final tile to complete Thirteen Orphans, they get the tile even if another player can win.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rule-section">
                <h3>2️⃣ Payout Rules</h3>
                <ul class="rule-list">
                    <li>If a player <span class="highlighted">self-draws (自摸)</span>, all three opponents pay the full amount.</li>
                    <li>If a player wins from <span class="highlighted">a discard (放炮, Fàngpào)</span>, the discarder pays the full amount.</li>
                    <li>If <span class="highlighted">a player robs a Kong (抢杠胡)</span>, the player who declared the Kong pays for all.</li>
                    <li>If the dealer wins, the payout <span class="highlighted">doubles</span>.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <div class="rule-section">
                <h3>3️⃣ Special Considerations</h3>
                <ul class="rule-list">
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Heavenly Hand (天胡, Tiānhú)</span> – If the dealer wins immediately with their first tile, they win double points.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Earthly Hand (地胡, Dìhú)</span> – If a non-dealer wins immediately after the dealer discards their first tile, they win double points.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Big Wins (大牌)</span> – Hands such as Big Winds (大四喜), Big Dragon (大三元), Four Kongs (四杠子), and All Honors (字一色) take precedence if multiple players could win.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlighted">Limit Hands (封顶牌)</span> – Some house rules may cap points at a certain limit (e.g., 32 points max).</li>
                </ul>
